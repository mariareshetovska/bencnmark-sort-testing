# Sorting Algorithm Benchmarks
This repository contains benchmark tests for two sorting algorithms implemented in Golang: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort and sorting from the standard package "sort". The benchmarks are designed to compare the performance of the two algorithms on random integer arrays of various sizes.

## Running the Benchmarks
To run the benchmark tests, navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the following command:

```go
go test -bench=.
```
This will run the Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and sorting from the standard package "sort" benchmarks and display the results in the terminal.
